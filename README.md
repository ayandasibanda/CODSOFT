# **This repository contains all the tasks given to me at Codsoft.**

[**Task 1: Number Game**](https://github.com/ayandasibanda/CODSOFT/blob/main/Task1.java)

In this task I had to generate a random number within a specified range as 1 to 100
Then prompt the user to enter their guess for the generated number.
After that, I had to compare the user's guess with the generated number and provide 
feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or low.
Steps 2 and 3 were repeated until the user guessed the correct number.

The following details were incorporated:
I limited the number of attempts the user has to guess the number and added the option
for multiple rounds allowing the user to play again.
Display the users score which can be based on the number of attempts taken or rounds won.

[**Task 2: Student Grade Calculator**](https://github.com/ayandasibanda/CODSOFT/blob/main/Task2.java)

The input will be the marks obtained by the students out of 100 in each subject
It will calculate the total mark by summing up the marks obtained in all subjects
It will calculate the average percentage by dividing the total marks by the total number of
subjects to get the average percentage
It will calculate the grade by assigning grades based on the average percentage achieved then
display the results, show the total marks, average percentage and the corresponding grade
to the user.

[**Task 3: ATM Interface**](https://github.com/ayandasibanda/CODSOFT/blob/main/Task3.java)
I created a class to represent the ATM. I designed the user interface for the ATM Machine and
included options such as withdrawing, depositing and checking the balance. I implemented methods
for each option, such as withdraw(amount), deposit(amount) and checkBalance().
I created a class to represent the user's bank account which stores the account balance.
I connected the ATM class with the user's bank account class to access and modify the account balance.
I validated the user input to ensure it is within acceptable limits and enabled it to display
appropriate messages to the user based on their chosen options and the success or failure of their 
transactions

[**Task 4: Currency Converter**](https://github.com/ayandasibanda/CODSOFT/blob/main/Task4.java)
In this task, my application allows the user to choose the base currency and the target currency.
It fetches real-time exchange rates from a reliable API (Yahoo API). It takes the input from the user
for the amount they want to convert. It the converts the input amount from the base currency to the target
currency using the fetched exchange rate. It then displays the converted amount and the target currency symbol
to the user.
