Task 1: Number Game
In this task I had to generate a random number within a specified range as 1 to 100
Then prompt the user to enter their guess for the generated number.
After that, I had to compare the user's guess with the generated number and provide 
feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or low.
Steps 2 and 3 were repeated until the user guessed the correct number.

The following details were incorporated:
I limited the number of attempts the user has to guess the number and added the option
for multiple rounds allowing the user to play again.
Display the users score which can be based on the number of attempts taken or rounds won.
